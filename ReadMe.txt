There are two ways to use this data.

(1) Install the package from github. The code is available at ... and should run immediately.
    Installation:
    > install("devtools") #if it is not yet available
    > require(devtools)
    > install_github( "lschlicht/DawnChorus")
    > require(dc)
    
(2) Download the files from the folders extdata, data and inst and run the functions.

The data in the folder "extdata" are .csv files that can be used independently of R.
